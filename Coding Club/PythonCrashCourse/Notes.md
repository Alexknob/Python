## Notes

### Data types

* Floating-point numbers are numbers with a . (decimals)
* String stores text variables: can use '...' or "..."
* Lists are indicated by [... , ...] with , between each item
* Booleans are True or False variables
* Dictionaries
    * Specialised data type in Python
    * similar to lists
    * each item in the list is given a name/key
    * keys are strings and corresponding values are any data type (integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries...)
    * indicated by {'key name': 'value name', 'key name': 'value name', ...}
    * look up dictionary items with print(dictionaryname['key name'])

### Maths & Boolean Operators

* & : logical and : True & True (answer : True), True & False (answer : False)
* | : logical or : True | False (answer : True), False | False (answer : False)
* ! : logical not : ! True (answer : False), ! False (answer : True)
* could replace, & with and, replace | with or, and replace ! with not

### Loops

### Functions

* define functions with `def`

### if-else

* allow for script decisions based on a variable

### Imports (packages, libraries, modules)

* essential packages
    * numpy = package around numbers
    * scipy = maths and stats
    * matplotlib = graphs
    * pandas = data imports
* installed with ``import```package name ``as`` package nickname
* called by indicating package nickname.function
