## Tutorial Aims

* Understand what Pandas is
* Ways of running Python and Pandas
* Understanding the basic Pandas data structures
* Learn how to access data from a Pandas DataFrame
* Learn how to filter data in a Pandas DataFrame
* Learn how to read and sort data from a file
* Understand the basics of the Matplotlib plotting package
* Learn how to bring together other packages to enhance your plots
* Learn how to further customise the appearance of Matplotlib plots
* Be inspired to experiment further with Matplotlib!


### Understand what Pandas is

* package to deal with data analysis
* simplifies loading data from external sources and databases
* allows data analysis and manipulation
* useufull for:
    * labelled data (= tabular data with headings associated with each column of data)
    * ordered and unordered time series data
    * matrix data with row and column labels
    * any form of statistical or obsrvational data sets (data does not have to be labelled to be placed into a pandas structure)
* fast way to deal with data
* in combination with another library called statsmodels


### Ways of running Python and Pandas

* Conventions when using Python
    * import pandas and give it a nick name
    * functions from the pandas package will later be then specified with ````pd.some_function_name()````
    
    
### Understanding the basic Pandas data structures

* Two Core Data Structures:
  * Series
      * one-dimensional array like structure
      * holds a column of data and an associated array of data labels called index
  * DataFrame
      * tabular data similar to a spreadsheet
      * columns storing a single data-type 
      * indexed by row or column names
  * Dictionaries
      * core data structure containing Key:value pairs
      * can contain multiple items seperated with a ,
      * corresponding values to keys can also be numbers, lists, tuples or other dictionaries
      * indicated with {}
      * look up items in the dictionary with []
